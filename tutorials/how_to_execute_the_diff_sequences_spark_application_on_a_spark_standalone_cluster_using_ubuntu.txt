HOW TO EXECUTE THE DIFF SEQUENCES SPARK APPLICATION (V0.9.9) ON A SPARK STANDALONE CLUSTER USING UBUNTU

___
Assumptions: - The Spark cluster is running (refer to 'tutorials/how_to_setup_and_start_spark_standalone_cluster_on_ubuntu.txt' file);

             - All nodes (Master and Workers) are accessible via CLI (terminal);

             - Their username is 'ubuntu'; and

             - Their CLI's current path is '/home/ubuntu'.

___
1) Clone the Diff Sequences Spark application repository (v0.9.9) into all nodes (Master and Workers):

	git clone https://github.com/alan-lira/diff-sequences-spark -b v0.9.9

___
2) Clone the SARS-CoV-2 input sequences directory into the Master node:

	(if git version >= 2.19.0)

	mkdir ./temp; git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/alan-lira/ccpe-2022-mapreduce-spark-cloud ./temp; cd ./temp; git sparse-checkout set input_sequences; mv ./input_sequences ../input_sequences; cd ../; rm -rf ./temp

	(otherwise simply clone the entire repository)

	git clone https://github.com/alan-lira/ccpe-2022-mapreduce-spark-cloud; mv ./ccpe-2022-mapreduce-spark-cloud/input_sequences ./input_sequences; rm -rf ./ccpe-2022-mapreduce-spark-cloud

___
3) Configure the Diff Sequences Spark application parameters, i.e., input settings, output settings, general settings, producer-consumer threads settings, and partitioning settings, on the Master node (may vary from experiment to experiment):

	vim diff-sequences-spark/config/differentiator.cfg

___
4) Configure the Diff Sequences Spark application submission settings, i.e., deploy mode, scheduler mode and allocation file, cluster maximum size (cores), cores per executor, memory per executor, driver cores and driver memory, on the Master node (may vary from experiment to experiment):

	vim diff-sequences-spark/config/spark_application_submission_settings.conf

___
5) Submit the Diff Sequences Spark application to the Spark Cluster from the Master node:

	$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit --master spark://{MASTER_IP}:{MASTER_PORT} {APPLICATION_SUBMISSION_SETTINGS_FILE} {APPLICATION_ENTRY_POINT} {APPLICATION_ARGUMENTS}

	where (Example): {MASTER_IP} = 10.0.2.1
		         {MASTER_PORT} = 7077
	                 {APPLICATION_SUBMISSION_SETTINGS_FILE} = diff-sequences-spark/config/spark_application_submission_settings.conf
	                 {APPLICATION_ENTRY_POINT} = diff-sequences-spark/diff.py
	                 {APPLICATION_ARGUMENTS} = diff-sequences-spark/config/differentiator.cfg
